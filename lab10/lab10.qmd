Uniprot has 251600,768 proteins
```{r}
round(183201/251600768*100, 2)
```


```{r}
string <-c("10", "100", 1, "1,000")
as.numeric(string) + 1

string<- gsub(",","", string)

##my function
remove_commas <- function(df) {
  df[] <-lapply(df, function(x) gsub(",", "", x))
  return(df)
}

remove_commas(string)

#Barry's function
rm_comma <-function(x){
 as.numeric(gsub(",", "", x))
}

```

## 1:Introduction to the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB)

PDB statistics

```{r}
stats<-(read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv", row.names = 1))

pdbstats<-apply(stats, 2, rm_comma)
```

```{r}
rownames(pdbstats) <-rownames(stats)
pdbstats
```



>Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

93.16%

```{r}
totals<-apply(pdbstats, 2, sum)

round(totals/totals["Total"]*100,2)

84.83+8.33
```

Skipping Q2-3
>Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?


>Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?


## 2. Visualizing the HIV-1 protease structure

>Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

The resolution is too low. It's 2Å. 

>Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have

308


>Q6: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain and the critical water (we recommend “Ball & Stick” for these side-chains). Add this figure to your Quarto document.

adding a nicer picture, colored by secondary structure with catalytic site ASP 25 shown in each chain along with MK1 drug.

## Using the bio3d Package

```{r}
library(bio3d)

pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```

>Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object? 

198

>Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues? 

HOH(127), MK(1)

>Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure? 

2

```{r}
attributes(pdb)
```

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

```{r}
head(pdb$atom$resid)
```

```{r}
aa321(pdb$atom$resid[pdb$calpha])
```

## Predicting functional motions of a single structure

Run a Normal Mode analysis (NMA) - a bioinformatics method to predict functional motions

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
modes<-nma(adk)
plot(modes)
```

```{r}
mktrj(modes, pdb=adk, file="modes.pdb")
```
